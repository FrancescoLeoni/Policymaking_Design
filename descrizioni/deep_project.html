				<h2>Deep Initiative</h2>
				<p>"The role of design in innovation policies is very fragmented across Europe. It is possible to recognize the effort of all European countries and regions to implement design programmes, although often tacitly, while others occupy a middle position with tacit and explicit design innovation policies. This lack of evaluations can lead to design innovation policies less effective and disconnected from the SMEsâ€™ activities.
	
				The DeEP project wants to fill this gap by developing and testing theoretical frameworks and practical tools aimed 	at evaluating the impact of design innovation policies both at a macro level (regional, national, European) and at 	a micro level (i.e., the direct impact of specific initiatives on the innovation process of SMEs).
							
				The resulting DeEP Evaluation Tool can become an instrument for policy makers, enterprises and other stakeholders 	involved in design innovation policy to evaluate the impact of these policies and will allow policy makers to 	strategically develop new design innovation policies across Europe." <p/>
